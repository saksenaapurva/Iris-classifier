Iris Dataset Classification using KNN Algorithm

This project deals with the classification of the Iris dataset using the K- Nearest Neigbour algorithm. 

The dataset contains the sepal and petal widths of certain flower species. 
Classification has been done in R Studio using R programming

After applying the algorithm, 8% of the species were incorrectly classified by the kNN classifier

Hence an accuracy of 92% is shown by the model
